# Netlify Deployment Guide for ShopHub

## Quick Deploy from Replit

### Option 1: Deploy from Replit (Easiest)

1. In your Replit project, click the **"Deploy"** button
2. Select **"Netlify"** as the deployment target
3. Configure the deployment:
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build:client`
   - **Publish Directory**: `dist/public`
4. Click **"Deploy"**

### Option 2: Manual Deploy to Netlify

1. **Connect your GitHub repository to Netlify**:

   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your ShopHub repository

2. **Configure build settings**:

   - **Build command**: `npm run build:client`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist/public`
   - **Node version**: 18

3. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy site"

## What This Setup Does

âœ… **Frontend-only deployment** - Your React app will work perfectly
âœ… **Mock data** - Products, cart, and orders work with sample data
âœ… **SPA routing** - All routes (`/products`, `/checkout`, etc.) work correctly
âœ… **Responsive design** - Works on all devices
âœ… **Theme switching** - Light/dark mode works

## Features That Work in Static Deployment

- âœ… Browse products
- âœ… View product details
- âœ… Add items to cart
- âœ… Update cart quantities
- âœ… Remove items from cart
- âœ… Checkout process (creates mock orders)
- âœ… Theme switching
- âœ… Responsive design
- âœ… All navigation

## Notes

- **Cart data** is stored in memory (resets on page refresh)
- **Orders** are mock orders (not persisted)
- **No backend** - This is a frontend-only demo
- **Perfect for showcasing** your UI/UX skills

## If You Need Full Backend Later

For a production app with persistent data, you'll need:

- A backend service (like Vercel Functions, Netlify Functions, or Railway)
- A real database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Authentication system

But for now, this static deployment showcases your frontend perfectly! ðŸŽ‰
